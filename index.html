        <p1>Hi! Captain Quail here. Thank you for visiting my website. I am a indie game developer. My main engine is Clickteam Fusion 2.5. I'm also focused on 3D modelling for game development. Since 7th grade I have participated in FIRST robotics and fell in love with programming. As of 2015 i started learning game development using visual coding. Now, in late 2018, my focus is on hand coding using HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL and JavaScript. I hope to make indie games full time and learn even more engines like Unity, UE4, Cry and more. </p1>
